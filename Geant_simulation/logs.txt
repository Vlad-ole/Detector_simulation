*** G4Exception : GeomNav1002
      issued by : G4Navigator::ComputeStep()
Accuracy error or slightly inaccurate position shift.
     The Step's starting point has moved 0.598475 mm 
     since the last call to a Locate method.
     This has resulted in moving 5.88627 mm  from the last point at which the safety      was calculated 
     which is more than the computed safety= 0 mm  at that point.
     This difference is 5.88627 mm.
     The tolerated accuracy is 1e-06 mm.
  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

Accuracy error or slightly inaccurate position shift.
     The Step's starting point has moved 0.564134 mm 
     since the last call to a Locate method.
     This has resulted in moving 5.19245 mm  from the last point at which the safety      was calculated 
     which is more than the computed safety= 0 mm  at that point.
     This difference is 5.19245 mm.
