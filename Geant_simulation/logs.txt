*** G4Exception : GeomNav1002
      issued by : G4Navigator::ComputeStep()
Accuracy error or slightly inaccurate position shift.
     The Step's starting point has moved 0.528436 mm 
     since the last call to a Locate method.
     This has resulted in moving 3.40163 mm  from the last point at which the safety      was calculated 
     which is more than the computed safety= 2.7 mm  at that point.
     This difference is 0.701631 mm.
     The tolerated accuracy is 1e-06 mm.
  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

     The tolerated accuracy is 1e-06 mm.
  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

      issued by : G4Navigator::ComputeStep()
Accuracy error or slightly inaccurate position shift.
     The Step's starting point has moved 0.528436 mm 
     since the last call to a Locate method.
     This has resulted in moving 3.40163 mm  from the last point at which the safety      was calculated 
     which is more than the computed safety= 2.7 mm  at that point.
     This difference is 0.701631 mm.
     The tolerated accuracy is 1e-06 mm.
  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

Accuracy error or slightly inaccurate position shift.
     The Step's starting point has moved 0.528436 mm

     This has resulted in moving 3.40163 mm  from the last point at which the safety      was calculated 
     which is more than the computed safety= 2.7 mm  at that point.

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

Accuracy error or slightly inaccurate position shift.
     The Step's starting point has moved 0.528436 mm 
     since the last call to a Locate method.
     This has resulted in moving 3.40163 mm  from the last point at which the safety      was calculated 
     which is more than the computed safety= 2.7 mm  at that point.
     This difference is 0.701631 mm.

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6

     The tolerated accuracy is 1e-06 mm.
  This problem can be due to either 
    - a process that has proposed a displacement larger than the current safety , or
    - inaccuracy in the computation of the safety We suggest that you 
   - find i) what particle is being tracked, and  ii) through what part of your geometry 
      for example by re-running this event with 
         /tracking/verbose 1 
    - check which processes you declare for this particle (and look at non-standard ones)
   - in case, create a detailed logfile of this event using:
         /tracking/verbose 6
